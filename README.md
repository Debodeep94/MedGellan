# MedGellan  
MedGellan essentially addresses the problem of autonomous decision making system - in conventional hybrid making  system, the human or the machine takes the final decision. However, this strategy is optimal as this leaves one partner completely unassisted. To this end, we propose MedGellan - a decision making framework that provides guidance based on which the human takes the final decision.
